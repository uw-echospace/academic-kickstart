I am a student at the University of Washington majoring in Statistics with a Data Science concentration. I expect to graduate in Spring 2025 and plan to pursue a graduate degree in Statistics or Data Science.

I specialize in applying Python and R for data analysis. My hobbies are photography and composing. 

As a new member at Echospace, I am still in the learning phase. I am currently responsible for weekly field trips to the Union Bay Natural Area to deploy the acoustic loggers. My goal is to build a general buzz detector by the end of December. Although I'm new to the field of acoustics, I'm enjoying learning about the field because spectrograms are really cool!

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me via email.
