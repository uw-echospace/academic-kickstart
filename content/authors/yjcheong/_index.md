I am interested in developing methods that aid or improve conventional acoustic sensing/imaging techniques. An example of a highly effective acoustic sensing modality developed by nature is echolocation. By studying the processes and strategies exploited by echolocating animals to interpret acoustic information so effectively, we can learn how to build better acoustic systems. I am also interested in applying data-driven methods to acoustics, which are powerful tools that can enable the discovery of many interesting phenomena. 


My primary responsibilities within the group include: 
   * Developing and interpreting physics-based models to understand the complex interaction of sound with elastic media and gain insights into how it influences the perception of sound by toothed whales.
