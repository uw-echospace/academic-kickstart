I am a student at the University of Washington majoring in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in Digital Signal Processing. I am expected to graduate around the Spring of 2024 and am looking forward to pursuing graduate studies after receiving my bachelor's degree. 

I have experience in Java, Python, and Arduino. I am interested in using my programming skills to aid wildlife conservation efforts. My current project with Echospace involves monitoring the bat population at the Union Bay Natural Area, which is next to the Husky Stadium, using their echolocation call activity along with machine learning to develop an understanding of their foraging and social behaviors.

Feel free to ask me any questions at my email on pursuing research as an undergraduate!
